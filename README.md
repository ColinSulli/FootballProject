#Reads from the csv files in rawinput and pre-processes them accordingly. Spits output to the processed folder.
#calcprobs.py

#aggregate.py


Data:
#Rawinput
- Gets the raw output from scraper.py



Your project will have to include a complete implementation of your approach.  The software will have to be written in Python, and it will have to run on a Linux platform.  You can use external libraries as needed(provided they do not make the project trivial).  The grade for this part will be based on the quality of yourimplementation (which includes code documentation and a complete README file).  Please also include allthe datasets used in the project, including raw and annotated data (depending on the project).
